| **SDK 52** | **0.79.x** | ✅ **0.1.x**   | **Latest - Full support (requires prebuild)** |

**Note**: This library requires prebuild for Expo projects as it uses native modules.

## Platform Requirements

- **npm**: >=8.0.0
- **Yarn**: >=1.22.0 or >=3.0.0 (Berry)

## New Architecture Support

### Turbo Modules (React Native 0.68+)

This library is built as a Turbo Module and fully supports the New Architecture:

```typescript
// Automatically uses Turbo Module when New Architecture is enabled
import ImageCodeScanner from 'react-native-image-code-scanner';
```

### Fabric (React Native 0.68+)

The library is compatible with Fabric renderer but doesn't include UI components, so Fabric configuration is not required.

### Enabling New Architecture

#### For React Native 0.70-0.75

```bash
# iOS
cd ios && RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 pod install

# Android - in gradle.properties
newArchEnabled=true
```

#### For React Native 0.76+

New Architecture is enabled by default. To disable:

```bash
# iOS
cd ios && RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=0 pod install

# Android - in gradle.properties
newArchEnabled=false
```

## Migration Guide

### From React Native 0.6x to 0.7x

If you're upgrading from React Native 0.6x:

1. Update peer dependencies:
   ```json
   {
     "react": ">=17.0.0",
     "react-native": ">=0.70.0"
   }
   ```

2. Update iOS deployment target to 13.4 or higher

3. Update Android minSdkVersion to 21 or higher

### From Old to New Architecture

No code changes required! The library automatically detects and uses the appropriate architecture:

```typescript
// Same API for both architectures
const results = await ImageCodeScanner.scan({
  path: imagePath,
  formats: [BarcodeFormat.QR_CODE]
});
```

## Testing Compatibility

### Test Matrix

Run tests across different React Native versions:

```bash
# Test with specific React Native version
npx react-native init TestApp --version 0.79.2
cd TestApp
npm install react-native-image-code-scanner
```

### Automated Testing

The library is tested against:
- React Native 0.70.x (Old Architecture)
- React Native 0.75.x (Both Architectures)
- React Native 0.79.x (New Architecture)
- Latest React Native release

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Issue: Build fails on React Native 0.70.x with New Architecture

**Solution**: New Architecture requires React Native 0.68+. For 0.70.x, ensure Old Architecture is used.

### Issue: Expo Go doesn't work

**Solution**: This is expected. The library uses native modules that require prebuild:
```bash
npx expo prebuild
npx expo run:ios # or run:android
```

### Issue: TypeScript errors with React Native 0.7x

**Solution**: Ensure you have the correct @types/react-native:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/react@^18.0.0 @types/react-native@^0.72.0
```

## Support Policy

- **Active Support**: Latest 3 minor versions of React Native
- **Security Updates**: Latest 6 minor versions of React Native
- **Best Effort**: Older versions on case-by-case basis
